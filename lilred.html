      <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>Lil' Red is one of two mascots representing University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln's athletic teams. Lil' Red is the newest mascot, having been created for the 1993 season after a statewide contest run for that purpose. Associate athletic director Dr. Barbara Hibner was the driving force behind Lil' Red.[3]

        Lil' Red can be seen on the sideline at Nebraska college football games at Memorial Stadium, along with other university sporting venues such as Pinnacle Bank Arena during basketball games and at the Bob Devaney Sports Center for volleyball matches. The mascot is currently produced by Signs & Shapes International, Inc. based in Omaha, Nebraska. The operator of the costume wears a "PowerBelt," a belt with an air circulation system, which brings in over 100 cubic feet (2.8 m3) of fresh outside air per minute, enough fresh air to accommodate roughly 1,000 people. Due to the mascot's incredibly light weight, the larger-than-life mascot can run, dance, crowd surf and shake hands.
        
        Since its installment, Lil' Red has won the national championship at the NCAA National Mascot Competition in 1999, and was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2007, which selected its winners by an online vote.[4]
        
        The costume was designed to appeal to children and has become a recognizable piece of Nebraska athletics culture.
